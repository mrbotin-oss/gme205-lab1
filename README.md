# Reflection

# Abstraction
Abstraction is a scientific judgement, and since the data that matters are the location of each points. Then we should be able to inspect and check each points if they have the needed information needed.

# Representation
After looking at our data, we should be able to know what should we do with our data. How we represent our data affects the analysis outcome.

# Responsibility
Responsibility is knowing what should be in every data and what is the correct script to produce an output. Scripts can automatically check for our wrong spacing and formatting and punctuation marks but we as a creator should check the spelling of our scripts. We should also undersand what we're trying to achieve as our analysis outcome in order to verifying that the code actually solves the intended problem.

# Scale
This is the geocomputational thinking of knowing how big our area of interest is. In this activity, we have our points that has coordinates in it. Coordinates help with working in scale because they preserve consistent relationships between our data, whether we scale it up or down the relative distances and positions between points remain the same. This makes it possible to resize maps, models, or visualizations proportionally without distorting spatial relationships.
